        <h3>Kaija Saariaho</h3>
        <center><img src="saariaho-headshot.jpg" width="40%" height="auto" alt="Image showing headshot of Kaija Saariaho"></img></center>
        <p>Kaija Saariaho (1952-2023) is a Finnish composer who extensively explored the use of timbre in her works. She moved to Paris in 1982 and began to codify her sound during that time. Upon her arrival in Paris, she began to work at <i>Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique</i> (IRCAM), which marked the beginning of her experiments with electronics.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>IRCAM Years</h3>
        <p>Saariaho’s time at IRCAM was generally very productive but not without challenges.</p>
        <p>For Saariaho, this collaborative relationship was further strained by gender dynamics at IRCAM. [Georgina] Born has analyzed at length the ”sexual division of labor” in 1980s IRCAM, in which “the lower-status sphere of reproduction was associated with women and the higher-status production domain almost exclusively with men.” With very few exceptions, the studio technicians, composers, and researchers at IRCAM were men, while women occupied “supporting” clerical positions or, if they held higher offices, worked in departments relating to public relations, concert organization, etc. This environment presented Saariaho with real obstacles, requiring her to do the additional emotional labor of managing the feelings of technicians assigned to her and to gain levels of technical competency not expected from male colleagues. (Cobb 2024, 187).</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges Saariaho continued to refine her craft, and went to great lengths to learn LISP and FORMES to continue working after the end of her tenure as a ‘visiting composer’ at IRCAM.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        
        <h3>The ballet <i>Maa</i></h3>
        <p>Maa is a Finnish word which can be translated to ‘Earth’. This was a ballet which comprised 7 parts, and utilized a mixture of live instrumentalists, dancers, and electronics. This piece is primarily non-narrative, and instead relies on association to communicate its themes emotionally (Nuorvala 2024).</p>
        <p>The piece premiered in Helsinki in October of 1991.</p>

        <h3>Notes about <i>Journey</i></h3>
        <p><i>Journey</i> is the first movement of the work. It is a piece for tape, and in performance there are no dancers on stage.</p>
        <p>The piece is primarily composed of a rhythmic foregrounded motive, with the background material being a collage of various environmental sounds. Additionally, there is a mix of whispered phonemes and whispered French.</p>

        <h3>Saariaho’s approach to form</h3>
        <p>Saariaho utilizes Vassily Kandinsky’s definition of form, which states “Form is the external manifestation of inner meaning” (Saariaho 1987, 93).</p>
        <p>Saariaho writes that the exploration of dynamism and stasis is a primary driver of formal development in her works (Saariaho 1987, 94).</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Form and timbre</h3>
        <p>Feeling as though organization of form based on tonal function is a thing of the past, Saariaho began to experiment with relating timbre to harmony, specifically mapping the axis of noise/pitch to dissonance/consonance (Saariaho 1987, 94).</p>
        <p>Noise can present itself in different ways, with harsh and chaotic sounds or soft yet unfocused sounds. Saariaho defines this as “breathing, the sound of a flute in a low register or a string instrument playing ‘sul ponticello.’” (Saariaho 1987, 94).</p>
        <p>Pitch (or pure sounds) are generally regarded as things such as “the ringing of a bell or human voice singing in the western tradition” (Saariaho 1987, 94).</p>
        <p>Interesting to note that this does not necessarily refer to the harmonicity of a sound, but rather presence of a pitch center.</p>

        <h3>Four distinct sections in <i>Journey</i></h3>

        <img src="journey-pt3.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Spectrogram of 3:13-5:08 of Journey."></img>
        <p>Part 4:</p>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Overall pitch/noise relationships</h3>
        <p>Moving from noise to pitch from 0:00-2:15, with a soft cadence at 2:15.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:00:00" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>2:15-3:13 creates a clear trajectory from pitch back to noise, beginning with a C#4 resonance (277hz) which gradually fades, while the metro ambience becomes more pronounced, culminating in the addition of the spoken French to close the gesture.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:02:15" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>3:13-5:08 is a development on the previous phrase, introducing the sounds of the countryside (and with it birds). The rhythmic motive begins relatively short in terms of its decay, but generally becomes longer and with it, noisier throughout this section.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:03:13" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>5:08-7:32 comprises the last section. This cadential section moves in the inverse of those which came before it, beginning with just the sound of waves and moving slowly toward a sustained drone of the following approximate frequencies: [188, 258, 370, 558, 662, 1175, 1325, 2650]</p>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Development of timbre in foreground material</h3>
        <p>At this point, it makes sense to look at the materials themselves. For this, I will focus primarily on the rhythmic element, which the composer identified as footsteps.</p>
        <p>From 0:00-2:15 we are presented with an initial tapping, which quickly stabilizes itself to become the primary foregrounded material. Transformations here are not gradual, but sudden. Use of panning is the primary driver of change over time.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:00:00" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>2:15-3:13 introduces timbral transformations of the footsteps which help propel us to the arrival at 3:13. Something interesting to note here is that the rate of development in the timbral shift increases as we push to the articulation at 3:13.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:02:15" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>The section from 3:13-5:08 contains a number of interesting transformations. Our rate of development resets to a slower pace in this section, following the previous gesture. In this section, the transformations morph from their homophonic changes as they had been previously presented into polyphonic ones, with different timbres introduced abruptly on top of others. This polyphony begins to transform back to homophony around 4:30, finally reaching true homophony at the 5:00 mark for the climax of the piece.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:03:13" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>The final section, from 5:08-7:32, replaces the footsteps with waves as the foregrounded material, which are slowly filtered into the static chord which ends the piece.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:05:08" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Source-bonding as a means of understanding internal relationships between elements</h3>
        <p>An aspect that struck me with this piece is how the interplay between the foreground and background material affects how I perceive the sound of the footsteps. As mentioned earlier, there are no performers on stage during this movement of the ballet. To me, there is something interesting about the concept of listening to footsteps in a ballet (something to which my knowledge is generally undesirable) without any actual dancers present. For this reason I advocate that acknowledging the role of source-bonding in this piece is important.</p>
        <p>The piece begins with a repeated snippet of sound, which sounds very machine-like. A second sound is introduced, which is more resonant, but does not yet sound fully like footsteps until the introduction of the creaks in the floorboard at 0:37.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:00:37" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>The foreground motif is decidedly footstep-like until the introduction of the rain storm, with the footsteps almost disappearing into the texture and blending with the sound of rain. This continues until at 1:22, the steps regain their independence from the background.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:00:50" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>The next interesting shift comes at 1:41. I initially thought that the background in this section consisted of the sound of thunder, which is fairly logical given the section of rain which preceded it. I then experience the footsteps becoming part of the roll of thunder. It was only after seeing the score that I realized this was the sound of birds flapping.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:01:41" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>At the texture change at 2:15, the steps return to the machine-like timbre they had at the opening of the piece, and I am once again unsure of the source.</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:02:15" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>The next point of interesting source bonding comes at 3:22, where the interplay between the sounds of birds causes the foreground motif to embody the flapping of wings. It is only at 3:50 that I feel the steps sound decidedly like footsteps, and I then begin to source-bond their respective materials (snow, sand, etc.).</p>
        <audio controls src="journey.mp3#t=00:03:22" type="audio/mpeg" preload="auto"></audio>
        <p>The rest of the piece is then symbolic of a static reflection for me, the semiotic meaning of travel as taken from the footsteps concluded. This arrival at the destination feels profound, and the transformation of waves to drone removes me as the listener from imagining the real and into imagining the spiritual or alien.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>I think that each of the different approaches to analyzing this piece yield different yet complementary outcomes. The true nature of the piece is probably somewhere between all three.</p>
        <p>I was initially very taken by the source-bonding/semiotic approach I took in my third approach, but feel as though this may be my personal bias. The more I listened, the more I lost some of the interplay and wonder I had from my first listen.</p>
        <p>I think that the first and second approaches in tandem are likely most in line with Saariaho’s thinking regarding her composing.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>Is one approach better than the other? When we are analyzing a work does meaning-making get in the way of analysis?</p>
        <p>Why do you listen to music? What elements do you enjoy the most?</p>
        <p>How did your understanding of this piece change over the course of this presentation?</p>
