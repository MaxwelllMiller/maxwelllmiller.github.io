        <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
        <p>My proposed dissertation topic is to examine shared relationships between auditory and visual elements in João Pedro Oliveira’s visual opera, <i>The 70th Week</i>.  Ultimately, understanding these shared relationships allows us greater understanding of form and structure as well as how Oliveira uses multimedia elements to influence audience perception.</p>

        <h3>Why this topic?</h3>
        <p>I have long enjoyed João Pedro Oliveira’s works, and have been excited to take a closer look at one of his latest works, <i>The 70th Week</i>.  I have analyzed several of Oliveira’s works in the past and have found some common themes between both his electroacoustic works as well as his visual music.  Additionally, I am fascinated by audiovisual/multimedia works, and seek to deepen my knowledge of this topic.</p>
        <p>I think that this piece is particularly well suited to analysis in this way.  Oliveira wrote this during the pandemic and conceived of an opera where everything was recorded and set in fixed media (elcolegionacionalmx 2023, 8:45).  This proves an ideal setting for a visual music piece such as this as there are no dynamics of live performance to contend with for the audience.</p>

        <h3>What is a Visual Opera?</h3>
        <p>I think it is best to start with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qXpQGqZEw">snippet</a> of the piece first!</p>
        <p>There are many terms which are used to describe interdisciplinary works such as <i>The 70th Week</i>.  Audio-visual art, intermedia, visual music, multimedia art, and the list goes on.  Mick Grierson makes an interesting observation in his writing “Creative Coding for Audiovisual Art”, stating that audiovisual art is often treated as a sub-field in the various fields in which it interacts, when in reality it is a field in and of itself (Grierson 2018, 315).</p>
        <p>For the context of this work, we can define visual opera as an intermedia work which utilizes abstract visual elements and electro-acoustic music set in relationship to each other.</p>

        <h3>A Framework for Research</h3>
        <p>I break the foundation of this research into several pillars.</p>
        <p>First, it is important to gain a basic understanding of film theory and interplay between sound and cinema.  This is the most important area of research for this project, as these sources outline most of the foundational theories through which I will conduct analysis.</p>
        <p>Second, it is important to gain an understanding of analytical approaches for electro-acoustic music.  This allows us to relate textural and timbral changes in the audio with significant shifts in visual media, and look for patterns in the interplay between the two.</p>
        <p>Third, we will need what I consider to be the “glue” sources.  These are sources which include the piece itself, interviews and writings with the composer, and other supporting materials which help to understand the intent of the composer as well as connecting it to Oliveira’s other works.</p>

        <h3>Notable Sources</h3>
        <p>I have found several notable or interesting sources thus far in my research journey.  Most notably, I have found some excellent books on experimental cinema and the synchronization of sound and picture.</p>
        <p>One of the best sources I have found is Michel Chion’s <i>Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen</i>.  Chion is a French film theorist and composer who has made many contributions to both film theory as well as electroacoustic music analysis.  As such, his book takes a very informed and interdisciplinary approach to sound-picture relationships.</p>
        <p>Another great source is Adriano Abbado’s <i>Visual Music Masters: abstract explorations of past and present artists</i>.  This source focuses on development of visual music through time, and includes information on contemporary practices such as VJing as well as the use of electronics to create and realize art.</p>
        <p>Also notable is Graeme Harper’s <i>Sound and Music in Film and Visual Media: An Overview</i>.  This book contains several chapters which will be useful, and also includes some analyses of other works.  Finding a contextualized approach to analyzing audiovisual art will be important for my investigation into <i>The 70th Week</i>.</p>
        <p>Other interesting sources are Diego Ratto’s dissertation, “Music Expectation”, which is a dissertation on how different musical parameters affect listener experience. While this source is only tangentially connected to the work <i>The 70th Week</i>, I feel as though this may prove useful as Oliveira was the chair for the dissertation committee, and Ratto is a student of his.</p>
        <p>I will also mention Hazel Smith’s <i>The contemporary literature-music relationship</i>.  This is a book which examines the intersection between human voice and experimental music.  I feel as though this will be particularly relevant for my research, given the format and subject matter of <i>The 70th Week</i>.</p>

        <h3>Difficulties in Researching Intermedia/Interdisciplinary Works</h3>
        <p>As I alluded to earlier, there are some difficulties in researching interdisciplinary arts.  While there seems to be a wealth of scholarship about this topic, it is not organized clearly.  Sources are all over, and I have found that I need to approach information from a variety of sides.</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Lack of Previous Scholarship on Composer</h3>
        <p>An additional challenge that I have found is a lack of scholarship on the works of João Pedro Oliveira.  I find this surprising as he is a well known name within my own artistic community, and has received many awards throughout his career.  Because of this, I am able to contrast <i>The 70th Week</i> with some of his other works, but don’t have much scholarship that I can engage with when I do so.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Oliveira has not published many writings, which means I cannot easily reach for a “manifesto” of his artistic process.  To compensate for this, I am needing to use more general analysis techniques (such as Smalley’s Spectromorphology) in order to engage with the musical elements of this work.</p>

        <h3>Finding Success in Trans-disciplinary Research</h3>
        <p>Despite these challenges, I feel as though I have still managed to be successful in the research process.  I have found using Proquest to search through relevant dissertations to be a very helpful research tool.  Often, I am led to relevant sources which I wouldn’t have found with keyword/subject searches.</p>
        <p>I also have improved at approaching my subject from different sides, and have found lots of relevant and helpful information searching for books on film theory and cinematography.  This has allowed me to ‘hone in’ on my topic in a more complete manner, rather than just reaching from a single angle.</p>

        <h3>Thank You!</h3>
        <p>I have enjoyed researching this topic this semester, and am feeling as though I will have a good foundation for my future research here at UIUC.  Don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions, and I will do my best to answer them.</p>
