        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi!  I’m Maxwell Miller, but you can call me Max.  I have been creating music since 2015.  I am originally from Washington State, and grew up in the mountains of Central Washington.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Why do I write music?</h3>
        <p>People have many different motivations for doing things.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Semi-Spiritual Experience</p>
        <br>
        <p>Looking back, I think it is more of a necessary thing for me as someone who enjoys music.  I have always been fascinated with building and modifying things; learning how they work and go together.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Has been a path which has been impactful for me and I wish to try to give back how I can.</p>

        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>Well… this is when things get tricky.  I am still very much in my youth as a composer, and cannot point to any real niche or style.  Instead I would like to share several stories with pieces that demonstrate how those experiences have affected me.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        
        <h3>Story #1: The true and solemn duty of an undergraduate composer.</h3>
        <p>Things were not going well for me compositionally, and I had a fair amount of friction with my composition instructor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I had fallen into a trap of doing things which I deemed “correct” and not things that were authentic.  I became very concerned about what I “should” be doing and not what I wanted to be doing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This created a period of frustration for me as I struggled to find my voice, but ended up writing a piece inspired by my struggle.</p>

        <h3>Story #2: A study in failure because of course I can do everything all at once.</h3>
        <p>I had started my masters degree and had been given essentially unlimited creative freedom, backed by very supportive mentors.  I got very ambitious with my projects, and began to become infatuated with expanding the scope of my intermedia work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>First time I had received grant funding for “research”.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite this the technical demands of performance quickly eclipsed my own capabilities.  I learned that there is more to having a piece be successful than having a really good idea.  The execution is important.</p>

        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Story #3: Less is more and I’m not happy about it.</h3>
        <p>I began pulling together my thesis project, and was struck with inspiration (which is certainly not tied to stress in the slightest).</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>I bought a guitar.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Which is certainly different from the time that I bought all those synthesizers, the pedal steel guitar, the 8 string guitar, the modular synth, the accordion, or the other guitar.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The thesis was titled <i>Existential Crisis (or the Art of Buying a Guitar)</i>.  I was again going to write something about myself and my experiences, but this time I wasn’t going to go as broad as <i>Flight Manifest</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This was of course a multi-movement, modular, standalone, audio-visual, improvised piece written in two programming languages I had never used before.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite these odds stacked against me, I managed to make something more coherent than <i>Flight Manifest</i>, but still struggled with the technical aspects of performance.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ncLgicFnk">Internal Monologue with a Captive Audience</a>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Interestingly enough the middle movement seemed to be the most effective.  The piece, titled Antithesis (this is the part where I scream) is actually just the part where I scream.  In all of the time I spent building the effects patch for the first and third parts, I had found that it sounded really cool to just scream into a cheap microphone through a bunch of effects.</p>

        <h3>Re: Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>I think it is easiest for me to categorize my work by looking at commonalities across individual works.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pitch is not super important to me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I frequently utilize technology, mostly as a means to create a more immersive environment for my audience.  I am particularly interested in audio-visual works.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am interested in music which has some sort of connection to myself or explores vulnerability.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I enjoy being involved in the music I create through improvisation or performance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All of this is subject to change.</p>
