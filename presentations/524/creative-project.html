        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p><i>Park and Ride</i> follows the story of Tim Clark, a recovering drug addict who goes to college to get an education in the visual arts.</p>
        <p>Act I follows him through adolescence, where we see him become alienated from his friends and begin to find solace in drinking and doing ecstasy.  During this time he also forms a relationship with a woman named Lydia, but it falls apart because she has a dream that he is destined for a future which won’t let them be together.  Tim begins living in his van, and often sleeps at the Park and Ride in the town he works.  Tim meets other people who live in their cars and he becomes friends with Andy and Melissa, a couple who frequently stay at the Park and Ride.  Local police begin to crack down on people living in their cars, and the community at the park and ride is broken apart.  Tim finds out shortly after that Andy had been shot and killed by a cop.  Finding himself again lost and isolated, Act I closes with Tim preparing to end his life, but he is interrupted by his father.  An argument ensues, and after the argument Tim realizes that the pain he masks with drugs is only transferred to those around him.</p>
        <p>Act II begins four years after the end of Act I, and we see Tim now attending classes at a university, studying to become a sculptor with the dream of teaching sculpting at a university one day.  He has been clean and sober for three years, and is a seemingly transformed person.  In one of his pottery classes, he meets Jayla, another artist, and they begin dating and quickly move in together.  Although things are going well between them, Tim finds himself growing distant from his friends and family.  They move across the country for Tim to pursue an MFA, but the new-found pressure of his creative and teaching endeavors cause their relationship to disintegrate.  Tim finds himself alone once again, and due to some financial hardships needs to move back into his van.  Despite this adversity, Tim pushes through and is able to finish his degree, but realizes that he is ultimately unhappy with where his life is and the people surrounding him.  His degree is conferred, but after a series of unsuccessful job interviews and his van being stolen, he finds the old shotgun shell he was going to use to kill himself several years ago.  Deciding not to attempt to kill himself a second time, Tim packs his art supplies and some clothes in his backpack and begins to hitchhike back toward his birthplace.</p>

        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Thematic Material and Structure</h2>
        <p>Many of Sondheim’s shows focus on dreaming and how pursuit of individual goals come into conflict with those around the individual.</p>
        <p>Another frequent theme in Sondheim’s works is having characters which are artists.</p>
        <p>Much of Sondheim’s work uses experimental narrative techniques.</p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Lyric Elements</h2>
        <p>Themes of dreaming, sometimes acknowledged directly.</p>
        <p>Text is often reframed as the number continues.</p>
        <p>Words can carry double meanings but retain clarity.</p>

        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Musical Elements</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Harmony</h3>
        <p>Sondheim uses primarily tonal harmonic structures.</p>
        <p>Chords are usually extended but functional.  6/9 Chords create an “open” feel to the harmony.  <a href="lunch-chord.png">Example 1</a> and <a href="losing-chord.png">Example 2</a></p>
        <p>Chords frequently appear in inversions as a means of defying expectations.</p>
        <p>Frequently utilize delayed resolution to the tonic.</p>
        <p>Chromaticism used to create emphasis in text.</p>
        <a href="sunday-beautiful.png">Example from <i>Beautiful</i></a>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Melodic Writing</h3>
        <p>Sondheim tends to write melodies which unfold throughout the number.  <i>Finishing the Hat</i> is a great <a href="sunday-melody.png">example</a> of this.</p>
        <p>As a note, Sondheim often uses a mix of conjunct and disjunct motion in his melodies, and this is something which I didn’t do in <i>Commencement</i> due to my own vocal ability.</p>
        <p>Patter song as a symbol of an emotional breakdown; constant rhythmic energy to drive the music forward.</p>
        <p>Writing style is often based around speech, with a focus on intelligibility and preserving natural contours of the text.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>Accompanimental Figures and Quotation</h3>
        <p>Sondheim frequently relies on accompanimental vamps to create a harmonic foundation for the vocal line.</p>
        <p>Quotation and diegetic sound plays an increasingly important role as time goes on.  Mahler quotation in <i>Ladies who Lunch</i>, ‘show in a show’ in <i>Follies</i>, Factory whistle and Westminster bells in <i>Sweeney Todd</i>, <i>Good Thing Going</i> in <i>Merrily</i>, by the time we get to <i>Assasins</i> we are using whole numbers (<i>Hail to the Chief</i> and <i>America</i>).</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Where <i>Commencement</i> fits in chronology.</h2>
        <p>In my mind, I view this number as fitting into early 80’s Sondheim.</p>
        <p>Mostly minimal accompaniment, similar to what we see in <i>Sunday</i>.</p>
        <p>Heavy emphasis on dreams, talking about dreaming directly (as we see in <i>Merrily</i>).</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Writing Process</h2>
        <p>General word vomit, capturing the sort of feelings I’d like to have in the song.</p>
        <p>Wrote and then revised lyrics.</p>
        <p>Chunked them into the formal structure I wanted, then rewrote, breaking them out by rhythm.</p>
        <p>Input into notation software on a single pitch.</p>
        <p>Developed accompanimental figures.</p>
        <p>Molded melody to accompaniment.</p>
        <p>Revise again!</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>What I may change/improve.</h2>
        <p>I feel as though the lyrics could be sharper.</p>
        <p>As I have developed the show/character I have pulled out characteristics which seem like they would be important to highlight.</p>
        <p>Adding more theatrical elements to the performance.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
        <br><br><br>
